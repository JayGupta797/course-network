# Stanford CPN

This project concerns itself with the Stanford Course Prequisite Network (CPN) during the 2023 and 2024 academic year.
Understanding the relationship between courses is of great importance to a Universityâ€™s educational mission. 
We employ a range of supervised and unsupervised methods to understand and ultimately and inform the Stanford educational structure.
